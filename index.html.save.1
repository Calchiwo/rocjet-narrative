        <div class="section">
            <strong>Company Name:</strong><br>
            Rocjet Technologies Ltd<br><br>
            <strong>Founder:</strong><br>
            Caleb Chikanka Wod            <strong>Founded:</strong><br>
            April 30, 2025<br><br>
            <strong>Industry:</strong><br>
            Information Technology Consulting & Digital Innovation
        </div>

        <h2>Origin of the Name – The Story Behind ‘Rocjet’</h2>
        <div class="section">
            “Rocjet” was born from a simple misspelling of the word “Rocket.”<br>
            But this wasn’t just a typo—it was a sign. A symbol of where I’m headed.<br><br>
            It represents my bold vision, my unshakable passion for space exploration, and my belief in taking flight—even when the world doesn’t see the full picture yet.

            <blockquote>
                “Rocjet represents where I’m going, not just what I’m doing now. It’s a reminder that this company is my launchpad—not my destination.”
            </blockquote>
        </div>

        <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
        <div class="section">
            To deliver cutting-edge IT consulting solutions that empower businesses to innovate, grow, and operate more efficiently—while quietly laying the foundation for a legacy in space, technology, and African advancement.<br><br>
            Rocjet was not built to chase profit. It was built to chase proof—that I can start something, grow it, and exit it intentionally.<br>
            Not for money—but for momentum.
        </div>

        <h2>Vision Statement</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <blockquote>
                “Rocjet Technologies Ltd is not my destination—it’s my beginning.<br>
                I built it not for profit, but for the experience, the lessons, and the story.<br>
                It’s the company I must exit from to unlock the journey ahead.”
            </blockquote>
        </div>

        <h2>My Strategic Flow</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Rocjet Technologies Ltd</strong> – my first startup. I’ll gain experience, build my story, and exit.</li>
                <li><strong>Co-found and lead other startups</strong> – I’ll gain equity, leadership experience, and create major exits.</li>
                <li>Use those exits to fund<br>
                    <strong>KGE Global Holdings Ltd</strong> – my dream conglomerate, with KGE Aerospace as a key division.
                </li>
                <li>Fulfill my lifelong dream of becoming the first Nigerian astronaut, through a privately funded space mission by my own aerospace company.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <h2>Why Rocjet Must Succeed</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Because it's my beginning.</strong><br>
                    Rocjet is the first step in a very long journey. This is where I prove I can build and let go.</li>
                <li><strong>Because it’s the story that matters.</strong><br>
                    The world will remember how I started—not just how I finished. Rocjet is part of that legacy.</li>
                <li><strong>Because it teaches me discipline, execution, and clarity.</strong><br>
                    Even without chasing profit, I must build something real and valuable. That discipline will shape every company I touch next.</li>
                <li><strong>Because it unlocks my true dream.</strong><br>
                    Rocjet’s exit is my key to returning home—to my vision of space, science, and a world-shifting future under KGE.</li>
